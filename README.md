## Introduction

SUF is a unit frame framework derived from oUF 
The goal of SUF is to create a unit frame framework that supports both retail and classic wow. 

By itself SUF doesn't do much, a layout is required.

## Documentation

All the documentation can be found in the source code (until we publish it online).  
If you're upgrading to version 7.0, see our [upgrade guide](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55422).

## Embedding

If you intend to embed oUF into your project, please refer to our [embedding wiki page](https://github.com/Wutname1/SUF/wiki/Embedding).
