# SUF


## Introduction

SUF is a unit frame framework derived from oUF 
The goal of SUF is to create a unit frame framework that supports both retail and classic wow. While staying as close to parity with oUF as possible.

By itself SUF doesn't do much, a layout is required.

## Why the name change?

My initial thought on a name change is to avoid compatibility issues that can arise if the user has installed oUF on their own but your addon expects sUF. Initaly this should be a non-issue but as the years go by, I can see the 2 projects getting more split apart. A good example of this is how [Plex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_(software)) was originally just an XBMC fork but after a few years and competing design philosophies it became its own software. Of course it goes without saying all credit will be given where due to the original project and dev's of oUF.
